Rather than create your own professional website at the root directory for whatever domain name you chose, we're going to make a Wordpress website within your `sandbox` sub-directory on your Reclaim Hosting server, specifically **within a specific sub-folder (sub-directory)** of your `sandbox` folder. The name of this sub-directory is going to be `website`. So when you're asked for Directory (Optional), type in: `sandbox/website`

Note: choose a username and password that you can remember and **copy/paste it somewhere for your reference.** This is what you're going to use to log in to this Wordpress site moving forward.

Instructions: <https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/installing-wordpress/265>.

Now you should have a website installed under `http://yourdomainname/sandbox/website`. If you go back to Reclaim Hosting's `File Manager` and go back to `sandbox` folder, you should now see a new folder called `website`. If you look inside here, you will see a bunch of new folders and files that were automatically generated to "build" your Wordpress site. 

To actually start modifying your website, you need to log in to the Wordpress dashboard (separate from Reclaim Hosting). The login page will be: `http://yourdomainname/sandbox/website/wp-admin`, and you will use the username and password you specified when you installed Wordpress. Visit this URL and make sure that you are able to log in.
