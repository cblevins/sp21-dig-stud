## V. Class Choice

YOU will be in the driver’s seat in April. The class will vote on a topic(s) or method(s) that they would like to learn more about. This can consist of revisiting a topic (ex. “we want to know more about spatial history”) or exploring a brand-new one (ex. “we want to learn about machine learning”). I will then select readings and activities for these topics.
