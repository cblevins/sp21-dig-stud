**Assessment**

Assessment will be tailored to fit each student's needs. At the beginning of the semester, you will work with me to define: a) your individual learning goals for the course, and b) your strategy for how to achieve those goals. During the semester I will be giving you qualitative feedback on how you're progressing towards those goals in terms of assignments, activities, and contributions to the class. You will have opportunities to change paths during the course of the semester depending on how your interests develop. Finally, at the end of the semester you will be evaluating and reflecting on your work during the semester. Different students will have different learning goals and pathways towards those goals. Although I will be giving you a final grade, I will not be using standardized criteria for determining that grade. In short, I don't want you to ask "What do I need to do to get a good grade?" and instead ask "What do I want to get out of this class and how will I accomplish that?"

**Office Hours**

My office is located in Meserve Hall Room 237. Given the variability of graduate student schedules, I will not be holding weekly office hours at a set time. Instead, please contact me to set up a time to meet that works for both of us.

**Computers**

Because this is a digital history course, we will be using a variety of software and applications both inside and outside of the classroom. Please bring a laptop to class - if you do not have access to one, look into borrowing one from the library's [different options](https://www.northeastern.edu/its/services/tech-support/classrooms/equipment-checkout/) or contact me to make alternative arrangements.

**Slack Workspace**

We will be using a Slack workspace (<https://f19-dig-hist.slack.com/>) for announcements, posting discussion questions, distributing readings, sharing datasets, etc.

**Health and Wellness**<br>
Your ability to learn is often shaped by external factors outside of the classroom. Every student should prioritize their physical, emotional, and mental health. Any student who is struggling to do so (lacking a safe and stable place to live, having difficulty affording sufficient food to eat every day, facing financial stresses, etc.) is urged to contact [We Care](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/) or the [University Health and Counseling Services staff](http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/). If you are comfortable doing so, please contact me directly if you need to discuss any issues that are impacting your ability to learn in this class.

**Reasonable Accommodation**<br>
Students with documented learning disabilities will receive reasonable accommodation in this class. If you have a learning disability, please notify me and also register with [Northeastern’s Disability Resource Center](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/) at 20 Dodge Hall or call 617-373-4428.
 
**Title IX**<br>
Northeastern’s Title IX Policy prohibits discrimination based on gender, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic violence, and stalking (for more information, see the website for the Office for [University Equity and Compliance](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/). The Title IX Policy applies to the entire community, including male, female, transgender students, and faculty and staff. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted,confidential support and guidance can be found through [University Health and Counseling Services staff](<http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/>) and the [Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service clergy members](<http://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/>). By law, those employees are not required to report allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the University. Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Gender Equity and Compliance at: titleix@northeastern.edu and/or through NUPD (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121). Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD does NOT commit the victim/affected party to future legal action.

**Academic Integrity**<br>
All students are responsible for understanding and complying with Northeastern University’s policy on Academic Integrity. Cheating or plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated and will be immediately referred to the Office of Student Council and Conflict Resolution, For more details, see [the university's official policy](<http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/>).
