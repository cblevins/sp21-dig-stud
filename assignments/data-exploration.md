title: Data Exploration
---

You will select a dataset from a curated list that Professor Blevins will provide you. Your goal is to explore the dataset and write a short post about the data. In the first part, you will write a "data biography" that describes: Where did the data come from? Who collected it? How was it collected? Why was it collected? Do you see any problems or issues with it? In the second part, you will use Tableau Public to visualize the data in some way (chart, map, etc.). What is the overall shape of the data? Do you notice any patterns? Based on your exploration, what kind of questions might you be able to answer using this dataset? To communicate your findings, you may either export images from Tableau Public or embed a Tableau Public workbook into your post.

*Due during Weeks 9-10. Send Professor Blevins a URL to your post.*
