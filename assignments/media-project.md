Note: only for graduate students signed up for HIST 5260.



For one class during the semester, you will present a short overview of a real-world digital history/humanities/journalism project related to the week’s topic. You will provide a SHORT (5 minute) introduction to the project along with how it relates to the week’s theme or readings. You are welcome to discuss its background, strengths or shortcomings, etc. but keep in mind that you do not have very much time. Plan out ahead of time exactly what you need to convey to your classmates so that they can understand the project and its relationship to the theme for that day. The goal of this assignment is two-fold. First, it will provide the class with a series of real-world examples of particular method or topic “in action.” Second, in trying to find your project you will get exposed to a wider body of digital history research. Please email or Slack DM me with the project you are thinking of doing the week before class so that I can approve it.

*Presentation due at the beginning of whatever class you've selected.*
